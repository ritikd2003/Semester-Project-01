## Semester Project 01 – Quantum Weak Measurement

This repository contains the materials developed as part of **Semester Project 01**, focused on understanding the fundamentals of **quantum weak measurement**, based primarily on the works of **Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman (AAV)** and **Duck–Stevenson–Sudarshan (SSD)**.

### Repository Structure

**Presentations/**
- `AAV_paper_presentation.pdf`  
  Presentation covering the basics of weak measurement following the original Aharonov–Albert–Vaidman (AAV) formulation.
- `SSD_paper_presentation.pdf`  
  Presentation discussing the refined treatment of weak measurements as given by Duck–Stevenson–Sudarshan (SSD).

**Reports/**
- `RP_01_Brief_Report.pdf`  
  A concise report summarizing the core ideas and results.
- `RP_01_Report_main.pdf`  
  The final detailed report containing theoretical background, derivations, analysis, and discussion.

**code/**
- `code_01_main.ipynb`  
  Main notebook implementing the weak measurement model and reproducing the key results.
- `code_02.ipynb`, `code_03.ipynb`  
  Notebooks used to generate animations by varying the coupling strength (ε) or the pointer shift (Δ).
- `animation.gif`, `animation_epsilon.gif`  
  Animations produced from the simulations, illustrating the evolution of the pointer distribution.

This repository serves as a complete academic record of the presentations, reports, and computational work carried out for the course project.
